            <p>You know I know how
                To make em stop and stare as I zone out 
                The club can't even handle me right now 
                Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out 
                The club can't even handle me right now
                (Eh,yea-ei-yeah,eh,yea-ei-yeah,eh,yea-yeah)
                The club can't even handle me right now
                (Eh,yea-ei-yeah,eh,yea-ei-yeah,eh,yea-yeah)
                (Can't nothing handle me right now, I see you D.guetta. Let's get 'em')

            <h2>Kings & Queens Lyrics</h2>
            <p>No damsel in distress, don't need to save me 
                Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me 
                And you might think I'm weak without a sword
                But if i had one it'd be bigger than yours
                If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
                We would pop champagne and raise a toast
                To all of the queens who are fighting alone
                Baby, you're not dancing on your own
            </p>

            <h2>Classic Lyrics</h2>
            <p>Woo girl, you're shiny
                Like a 5th Avenue diamond
                And they don't make you like they use to
                You're never going out of style 
                Woo, pretty baby 
                This world might have gone crazy
                The way you saved me, who could blame me?
                When I just wanna make you smile
                I wanna thrill ya like Michael
                I wanna kiss you like Prince
                Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
                Write a song for you like this 
                You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
                Thinking i was born in the wrong time
                One of a kind, living in a world gonr plastic
                Baby, you're so classic
            </p>
